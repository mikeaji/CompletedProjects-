### Project Description

I have developed a project which is my mobile application Checkers that provides the user the freedom to play in multiplayer mode or against an Artificial Intelligence opponent (AI mode) on an 8x8 board; the Checkers mobile application will function offline, without any internet access and all data will be present on the device at the time of installation, including all features and functionalities.
Technical aspects of using iOS-platform software development tools will  be evaluated as well as the software environment that the checkers game was designed and developed using Unity 3D engine which allows me to develop scenes by using the visual integrated development environment of Unity3D and implementing numerous methods and functions coded in the programming language C#. 




Firstly what is needed is a macbook or an imac with Xcode running on the system, once this is completed the checkers application can be run on the system and then uploaded to any iOS mobile/ tablet devices the user has. in addition to that; to be able to export to a device the user must have an Apple developer license to be purchased from the offical Apple site.
Once the license has been attained the iOS device in question has to be deployed and connected into the Mac system; next steps include the user going into Xcode and navigating to seetings, Window> Organizer. Whilst in the organizer the user must now select and choose Devices option at the top of the program - doing this will aid the device connected to be selected and developed on.
There now should be an opton to click a button called Portal - to then sign in using the user's unquie Apple ID and password to access control of downloads and certificates and profiles that can be manipulated on the device in question.
Once this has been completed, the next step would be to go on Unity 3D and select a series of options to then run and deploy the application to the device in question; File - Bulid settings and select iOS option and then click RUN.





## Getting Started 
In order to get my project working; you would need to be able to carry out the following:

### Prerequisites
To install and run this project, the following prereqisites must be installed and runnable on the system in question:
* Visual Studio
* Latest version of Unity Unity 3D
* Latest version of Xcode
* An iOS device
* A Mac computer which runs 0S X 10.11 or later 


### Step by Step guide to install the game 



### When it runs ( step by step process)


In order to install my application, a guide will be provided on how to install and play the game on an iOS device: 



![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86629561-88086180-bfc3-11ea-9619-5fb1a1e7933e.png)
                                                                                                              Firstly, the user will have to install Unity and will select the tab to ensure that the iOS build support is within the unity 3d system. 







![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86629729-bc7c1d80-bfc3-11ea-9146-20510859af7b.png)
                                  The user will have to go into build settings and change the platform from PC, Mac & Linux Standalone to iOS to ensure build success. 







![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86629849-e5041780-bfc3-11ea-808e-2a07e895081f.png)
                              The next step would be to select the option to switch platforms which will compile the scripts. By switching the platforms this then sets the bulid target of the current project to iOS, so this process allows unity to create an Xcode project to then reimport all assets within the project folder. 








![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86629925-0107b900-bfc4-11ea-9123-df40a1f23680.png)
                                       The next step would be to go into project settings window and select the option for the user to access the bundle identifier and amend the necessary boxes for the unique company name and product name. 





![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86629980-15e44c80-bfc4-11ea-99d1-0a5d1432debe.png)
                                      The next step would be to amend the inspector, which entails a significant factor within the installation of the application which is the Bundle ID that uniquely identifies the checkers application, so the user would have to manually enter his/her own companyName in the format Unity provides in the Textfield.   




![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86630012-2a284980-bfc4-11ea-87d0-852c5a30362a.png)
                                    The next step would be to then build and run the game engine and it will prompt you to save it in a folder file which can be changed in Xcode system option drop-down.

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86630066-40360a00-bfc4-11ea-915d-0d953cde9184.png)
                                      The user would then need transfer the build being loaded into the file of his/her naming choice. 

![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86630162-5fcd3280-bfc4-11ea-822b-5ec8631220f0.png)
                                     The user would then need to navigate down to the file which they called, and within that file will be the unity-iphone.xcodeproj file, which has all the compressed components and assets within it and select this. 






![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86630232-75425c80-bfc4-11ea-9324-d114f01932cd.png)
                                   The user would then need to connect their own Apple ID connected in order to connect it to thier apple device

                            This image shows how to enter the users Apple ID into the appropriate textbox; in regards to the Apple developer membership which gives you the priveliage to specific developer permissions and tools,so, the Apple ID is vital. 


![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86630406-b20e5380-bfc4-11ea-8aa2-d6d463b0e277.png)
                          This image  shows signing in and deployment information such as display name which appears on the users actual device. 


![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86630472-c9e5d780-bfc4-11ea-9348-905c0a4b0963.png)
                        This displays the code within Xcode whilst the game projection is finalizsed and ready to be run which is an output of the Xcode debug console; it holds data and lines where the Unity console is coming up with errors so this gives the developer the oppoortunity to debug data, and also to view what information is being passed within the Operating system. 



![13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67065783/86630536-dd913e00-bfc4-11ea-80ea-7474470eaecb.png)
                         Once all steps are completed, the build will prompt a successful alert and the application will appear on the home screen of the iPhone device. 











### Installation Problems 

The following description explains numerous problems which could possibly occur whilst completing the installation of the application and problems that could arise during the running time of the application.


Problem 1

Xcode software may not be up to date so this will require you to download the latest version, however this may arise more issues due to the fact that the lastest version of Xcode is distinctly required to correlate with the configuration of the version of Unity 3D engine you have.


Problem 2 

If the user has an older version of macbook e.g an older operating system, such as Mac Lion; this would require you to download the lastest Mac OS system which is Catalina - this could be a risk to the current OS system as it could delete and erase all current files on the system, so it would be advisable to create a backup drive or an external hardware drive as insurance of security of files and documents.
This is a vital and essential step in order for the application to be able to export the Checkers application on the users desire Apple iOS device.


Problem 3

Whilst completing the export and installation of the application in Unity to xcode, their could be an issue with the application bulid to come up with the prompt and message 'bulid unsuccessful' this issue could be due to the Sound script being an issue and needs to be removed from the build folder to ensure success of the build.
This bug is an on-going issue with iOS and Andriod devices, a working and probable solving solution to this problem is non-existence as of now and is a trail and error problem that fixes it, e.g adding more functions into the sound script which could potentially disrupt other functions in other scripts that potentially could jeopardize the full functionality of the application.




## Output on iOS Device


The following images displays the application being installed and able to use on a physical iOS device.
